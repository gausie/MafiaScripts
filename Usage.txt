Usage:


Prompts for number of turns to buff

Prompts for number of turns to execute

Prompts for which familiar to use


If you specify a negative number turns of buff, it will provide minimum 1 turn of each buff, including some more expensive ones (like Mick's Inhaler) only used in this scenario.  This is meant as "night before" buffing, when you still have a bunch of turn-free embezzlers to fight, and can then turn around the next day and use those same buffs on another set of free embezzlers, all without using any turns.


Standard buff package:

* Summon Preturnatural Greed demon

* Concert Winklered buff

* Game grid token

* Asdon Martin: Driving Observantly

* Knob Goblin Nasal Spray

* Knob Goblin Pet Buffing Spray

* Resolution: Be Wealthier

* How to scam tourist

* Polka of Plenty

* Leon's Phat Loot

* Mad Hatter Dances With Tweedles

* Thanksgiving Feast (including buying and/or cooking)

* Maximum of 5 Ambitious Turkey if you have Fist Turkey familiar (all drinking casts Ode To Booze first)

* Use Bag O' Tricks to increase buff lengths

If you specify more than 320 turns and have pantsgiving, it will run 5 adventures and then use a distention pill to either time-spinner (if possible), or eat (if no time spinner) another serving of thanksgiving, for up to 340 turns of Thanksgetting buff.

It will use the Adson Martin instakill before switching to Mayo Clinic, and eat one last mayo and buy a sphygmayomonometer before swapping out the mayo clinic.

It will make and use copies of Knob Goblin Embezzlers from the following sources:

* Chateau (fight only, not install)

* 4-d camera (1/day)

* Rain Doh (untested)

* Spooky Putty (5/day)

* LOV Enamorang (1/day)

* Shattering Punch

* Gingerbread Mob Hit

* Asdon Martin: Missile Launcher


If outfit "Barf" contains an accordion and a bakelite backpack, it will execute accordion bash in each combat.

Uses free combat (witchess or snojo) before each digitize to activate bag o' tricks "Badger Underfoot" buff.

Optionally clear gingerbread to grab candies and a chocolate sculpture (if you have 300 sprinkles) or gingerbread wine (if you don't have the sprinkles).  Useful because you will normally have a large number of pet buffs.  Requires Bandersnatch or Stomping Boots.

Feeds Robortender if he's your familiar with the following bonuses:

* + meat

Before casting buffs, automatically equips Oscus's outfit for -5 MP cost, KGB for -3 MP cost (or orcish rubber if that's not available), and brimstone bracelet for -3 MP cost.


If you have libram of resolutions, auto-burn mana between combats.


Automatically goes to castle in the clouds top floor when semi-rare timer expires (this is buggy, timer currently stops the script).  If last semi-rare was Mick's, it visits purple light district if available, or knob treasury if not.
