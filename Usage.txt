LinknoidBarf.ash:

This is a meat farming script.  It's focused on running Barf Mountain and copying embezzlers, and providing the buffs to optimize doing so, especially the complicated eating that goes into a Thanksgetting feast.

The Mayo Clinic is probably the single most important IotM for making this script work.  Without it, you're eating is going to be very less optimal.  Pantsgiving is also quite useful, but not so critical.

My design philosophy:  I want the script to be resilient, but I don't want it doing stuff with my account without permission.  It's allowed to buy necessary resources from the mall or NPCs or coinmasters, but it will never auto-sell or put anything on the mall.  I'm something of a packrat (for example, I like collecting solid gold jewels, I don't want them used automatically).  If you want to automatically sell stuff, you'll need a separate script for that.

My scripts will pop up warning messages to continue or abort in certain situations.  It will not change your workshed item, it won't run your Robortender without drinks, it won't buy a day pass, it won't drink without Ode to Booze, it won't eat without Mayo clinic installed, it won't run the gingerbread city, it won't maximimize your Summon Resolutions, any of these things WITHOUT your permission.


Usage:


 Prompts for:
 * number of turns to buff (-1 to buff with "night before" buffs, basically the minimum number of turns
 * number of turns to execute (-1 to only burn your free kills for the day)
 * which familiar to use (defaults to your current one unless you've fed Robortender a drive-by shooting already today)

 There are a number of prompts to warn you of important things, and give you a chance to cancel.  I recommend leaving them enabled at the beginning, but if you don't want interactivity, you can let the script use defaults by setting property LinknoidBarf.AutoConfirm=true

 Auto-buy/use one-day ticket if you don't have charter
 Auto-buy a print screen button using 111 BACON if available (assumes you have an infinite bacon machine)
 Turns in a trash for 3 fun funds
 Takes the lube shoes quest (and completes it if you run enough turns)

 If you specify a negative number turns of buff, it will provide minimum 1 turn of each buff, including some more expensive ones (like Mick's Inhaler) only used in this scenario. This is meant as "night before" buffing, when you still have a bunch of turn-free embezzlers to fight, and can then turn around the next day and use those same buffs on another set of free embezzlers, all without using any turns.


 Standard buff package (you're responsible for having a stockpile of stuff like Nasal Spray, Pet Buffing Spray, Be Wealthier, etc.):

 * Concert Winklered buff
 * Game grid token
 * Asdon Martin: Driving Observantly

 * Use Bag O' Tricks, Yendorian Express card, License to Chill to increase buff lengths

 * Eats optimized using Mayo Clinic (and with milk of magnesium):
 * Jumping Horseradish: Kicked in the Sinuses
 * Thanksgiving Feast (including buying and/or cooking)
 * Maximum of 5 Ambitious Turkey if you have Fist Turkey familiar (all drinking casts Ode To Booze first)
 * 1 Dirt Julep (low turn gen, but good buff)
 * Fills rest of liver with Sacramento wine
 * Activates Shrine to the Barrel God before eating or drinking, if appropriate class
 * Wears Mafia Pinky Ring before drinking
 * If you don't have Ode to Booze, it will send Buffy 2000 meat and request Ode befure drinking

 If you specify more than 320 turns and have pantsgiving, it will run 5 adventures and then use a distention pill to either time-spinner (if possible), or eat (if no time spinner) another serving of thanksgiving, for up to 340 turns of Thanksgetting buff.
 You can manually go up to 380 turns Thankgetting with Pantsgiving (stop and manually eat after 50 turns gives another fullness available), but it takes a cuppa Voracity, which is currently worth more than 40 turns of Thansgetting
 It will use the Adson Martin instakill before switching to Mayo Clinic, and eat one last mayo and buy a sphygmayomonometer before swapping out the mayo clinic.
 It will make and use copies of Knob Goblin Embezzlers from the following sources:
 * Chateau (fight only, not make painting)
 * 4-d camera (1/day)
 * Rain Doh (untested)
 * Spooky Putty (5/day)
 * LOV Enamorang (1/day)
 * Print Screen Button (1/day)
 * Digitize (re-digitize every 97 turns)
 * Obtuse Angel (should also be able to handle Reanimated Reanimator if that's an option, but don't have one to test with)
Wears scratch'n'sniff UPC codes if they're cost effective while fighting Embezzlers (not cost effective for Barf Mountain itself)
Casts Meteor Storm on embezzlers for +20 familiar weight
Increases monster level before initial embezzlers to try to stop them from dying prematurely

 It will also use free kills to extend the buff duration:
 * Jokester's Gun
 * Replica Bat-oomerang
 * Shattering Punch
 * Gingerbread Mob Hit
 * Asdon Martin: Missile Launcher


 If outfit "Barf" contains an accordion and a bakelite backpack, it will execute accordion bash in each combat.
 It will replace accessory 1 with mayfly bait when visiting running barf mountain until the swarms are used up for the day
 Uses free combat (witchess or snojo) before each digitize to activate bag o' tricks "Badger Underfoot" buff.
 Optionally clear gingerbread to grab candies, and if you have the Gingerbread Best outfit, a chocolate sculpture (if you have 300 sprinkles) or gingerbread wine (if you don't have the sprinkles). Useful because you will normally have a large number of pet buffs. Requires Bandersnatch or Stomping Boots, or a supply of fish-oil smoke bombs from the AT nemesis quest.

 Feeds Robortender if he's your familiar with the following bonuses:
 * + meat
 * + item
 * mana regen
 * hobo drops
 * candy drops
 It will only use drinks from that list you actually have, otherwise you will get prompted to continue without them (in case the mall prices aren't worth it)

 Grabs a pirate costume if trick-or-treating tot is your familiar.
 Doesn't cast familiar buffs if using tot.

 Visits protonic accelorator pack quest adventures, uses combat with a "drops" familiar in this priority:
 * Fist Turkey
 * Space Jellyfish (if elemental)
 * Intergnat
 * Rockin' Robin

 Before casting buffs, automatically equips Oscus's outfit for -5 MP cost, KGB for -3 MP cost (or orcish rubber if that's not available), and brimstone bracelet for -3 MP cost.

 If you have libram of resolutions, auto-burn mana between combats.
 * Uses source terminal Turbo.enh if it can use the mana for summons

 Also does massive mana burning via summon resolution at the beginning with maxing out MP:
 * Telescope look high
 * Cross the Streams (protonic pack)
 * Sweet synthesis +300% myst and +300% MP (if spleen available)
 * Spacagate vaccine +50% myst
 * Hawking's +200% myst
 * Ointment of the Occult +100% myst
 * Tomato Juice +50% myst
 * Glittery Mascera +15% myst
 * Oil of slipperiness or Oil of stability as necessary
 * Circle Drum
And restores mana using:
 * Free rests (using Pilgrim hat if available, else Chateau if available, else normal rest), wearing Pantsgiving if available
 * nuns
 * oscus' soda
 * eternal car battery
 * Yendorian Express card
 * License to Chill
 * and LOV tunnel

 Automatically goes to castle in the clouds top floor when semi-rare timer expires.  If last semi-rare was Mick's, it visits purple light district if available, or knob treasury if not.  Or billiards room if you haven't gotten your perm pool skill to 10.
 You must add a variable LinknoidBarf.HobopolisWhitelist=guildName if you want it to visit the purple light district (although maybe that's silly, you have to have gone through the sewers anyway to get there)
 Automatically removes effects and items which confuse KoLMafia.  Particularly, Papier Mitre gives +familiar weight, but it will cause all kinds of problems if you wear it while scripting.

 Accordion Buffs get shrugged if necessary to fit songs in head.  Unshruggable are Thingfinder, Polka, and Phat Loot.
 It will skip past Spookyraven quest if the counter is turned on, so it won't interrupt the script, but it will leave your Spookyraven setting alone

 In combat:
 * pickpockets
 * casts source terminal extract
 * uses Pantsgiving pocket crumbs





LinknoidMine.ash:

This is a 1970s volcano mining script.  There are others more advanced, but I just wanted something that would work.  The one I tried kept complaining about object detection not found.  I started from Smelltastic's hotmine, and added a bunch of automation to gear up, eat, drink, spleen, and borrow time before doing the mining.  It also gets a volcoino using the velvet outfit (if you have torso awareness), and tries to get a second one if it can buy (or has) the items for a bunker quest, and then buys another ticket if you have enough volcoinos.

You can skip the eat/drink/spleen part completely if you don't want it doing it.  Here's what it will do if you let it:
  * It will eat hi meins on Monday, and lasagna with field of gar the rest of the week.  With milk of magnesium.
  * It will drink perfect ice drinks (by price) and then top off with cheapest robortender drinks, with Ode to booze, paying Buffy 2000 meat if you don't have the Ode skill.
  * It will spleen using powdered gold, agua de vida, and carrot juice as a finisher
  * It will borrow time 20 turns from tomorrow (with your permission)

If you specify turns as -1, it will instead run until you're out of turns.  If you run out of turns, the last thing it will do is switch to outfit "Sleep"
